<h1> About me </h1>

<p> Hi! My name is Jennifer Ha and I am actively seeking a co-op position for the Fall 2020 term. I wanted to impress
my employer a little but more so I made this GitHub page. The goal for this page was to expand a little more of my resume, interests, 
and skills while expanding my knowledge on coding. I've taken a course that taught me HTML and CSS before, so now I'm refreshing
my brain. Next up is Python and SQL.</p>

<p> I am a 2B Science and Business student at the University of Waterloo interested in jobs relating to development of a company, project management, and I would
love to be introduced and start learning new skills. </p>

<p> I am a highly motivated individual who is not scared of taking on new challenges, risk is my middle name. I'm getting use
to the new normal and I hope that my next co-op opportunity will teach me even more than my first one did. </p>

<p> Other than school and academics, I love staying active and trying new things. Growing up, I participated on many sport teams
but my favourite still stands at basketball and soccer. I love the high pace and high energy games with an entire team working
together. Last summer, I started kickboxing as an extra workout. Starting to kickbox really got me into staying active 
and healthy and it even made me a morning person; morning workouts are my favourite. </p>
